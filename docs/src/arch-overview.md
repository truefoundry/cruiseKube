## Overview

CruiseKube operates as a closed-loop system through a set of **periodic background tasks**.
Each task has a clearly defined responsibility and can be enabled or disabled independently.

1. **Create Stats Task:**
Builds persistent, workload-level CPU and memory statistics from Kubernetes state and Prometheus metrics. These stats form the foundation for all optimization decisions and are stored for reuse.
2. **Apply Recommendation Task:**
Generates and applies CPU and memory recommendations to workloads in a controlled, incremental manner. This is the core task responsible for actually right-sizing workloads.
3. **Fetch Metrics Task:**
Fetches metrics from the cluster and exposes them as prometheus metrics.
4. **Node Load Monitoring Task:**
Monitors the CPU load on nodes and isolates nodes that are overloaded.

Together, these tasks allow CruiseKube to continuously optimize resources **without relying on manual tuning or reactive scaling**.

The high-level architecture consists of 4 components deployed using the **CruiseKube Helm chart**:

- **Controller**
    - Statistics Engine - Collects metrics from the cluster and stores them in the database
    - Runtime Optimizer - Optimizes the resources of the running workloads on the cluster
- **Webhook**
    - Admission Optimizer - Intercepts new pod creations and optimizes the resources of the pod before it is scheduled
- **Frontend**
    - Observable interface for recommendations - The frontend provides a user-friendly interface to view the recommendations and the potential savings
    - Setting User configurations per workload - The frontend allows the user to set the user configurations like priority, mode, etc. per workload
    - Potential savings once CruiseKube is enabled in Cruise mode - The frontend shows the potential savings once CruiseKube is enabled in Cruise mode
- **Database**:
    - Stores the statistics generated by the Statistics Engine - The database stores the statistics generated by the Statistics Engine
    - Stores the user configurations per workload - The database stores the user configurations like priority, mode, etc. per workload

### Statistics Engine

- Continuously evaluates CPU and memory usage for each workload
- Track instances of high CPU load and memory OOMs
- Derives stable statistics (percentiles, headroom, variability)
- Persists computed metrics in an internal datastore
- Built on **Prometheus** as the primary metrics source

### Runtime Optimizer

- Implemented as a reconciliation loop in `cruisekube-controller`
- Iteratively optimizes **running workloads**, one node at a time
- Keeps the priority of individual workloads into account to minimise disruption

### Admission Optimizer

- Implemented as a **mutating admission webhook**
- Intercepts new pod creations
- Rewrites resource requests using learned recommendations

## Control Flows

### Statistics Engine

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  %% CruiseKube Statistics Engine – Metrics Collection & Feature Building

  participant P as Prometheus
  participant T as Statistics Engine
  participant S as Kubernetes API Server
  participant DB as Database

  loop Every scrape/aggregation interval
    T->>S: List Pods, Nodes (metadata)
    T->>P: Query metrics (usage, throttling, pressure)
    T->>T: Calculate stats per namespace/workload/container
    T->>T: Compute aggregates (e.g., percentiles, peaks, trends)
    T->>DB: Persist container stats
  end

```

1. Connects to target cluster prometheus and cluster
2. Calculates stats related to CPU usage, CPU pressure, memory usage, OOM instances etc.
3. Stores the calculated statistics into database

### **Runtime Optimizer Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  %% CruiseKube Core Loop (simplified)
  participant C as CruiseKube Controller
  participant M as Database
%%   participant N as Node
  participant K as Kube API

  loop Every reconcile interval
    C->>M: Read usage + pressure signals (per pod/container)
    C->>K: Read node allocatable + pod placement
    %% C->>C: Partition pods (optimizable vs reserved)
    C->>C: Estimate StableDemand + SpikeDemand (PSI-adjusted if available)
    alt Fits within node capacity
      C->>C: Distribute SpikeDemand amongst pods
      C->>K: Patch pod resources in-place
    else Not feasible
      C->>C: Choose eviction candidates by priority
      C->>K: Evict pods until feasible
      C->>C: Distribute SpikeDemand amongst pods
      C->>K: Patch pod resources in-place
    end
  end
```

1. Connect to target cluster to iterate over nodes
2. Fetch workload statistics from DB
3. Adjusts resources in-place for pods on the node

### **Admission Optimizer Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  %% CruiseKube Admission Webhook – Scheduling-Time Optimization

  participant U as User / Controller
  participant K as Kubernetes API Server
  participant W as CruiseKube Mutating Webhook
  participant M as Database
%%   participant S as Scheduler
%%   participant N as Node

  U->>K: Create Pod
  K->>W: AdmissionReview (PodSpec)
  W->>M: Fetch historical usage(for workload / container)
  W->>W: Estimate StableDemand + SpikeDemand
  W->>W: Compute initial pod requests = Stable + Spike
  W-->>K: Mutated PodSpec (updated requests/limits)
%%   K->>S: Schedule Pod
%%   S->>N: Bind Pod to Node
%%   N-->>K: Pod running

```

1. Intercept pod spec
2. Fetch statistics from the controller
3. Mutate requests before scheduling
