# Setup

Get started by following below steps:

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes Cluster:** You should have a running Kubernetes cluster. You can use any cloud-based or on-premises Kubernetes distribution.
- **kubectl:** Installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Helm:** Installed for managing Kubernetes applications.
- **Prometheus:** You should have a prometheus installed in your cluster.
??? example "Installing Prometheus"
    We will setup a sample prometheus to read metrics from the ingress controller.

    ```bash
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
      --namespace monitoring \
      --create-namespace \
      --set alertmanager.enabled=false \
      --set grafana.enabled=false \
      --set prometheus.prometheusSpec.serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues=false
    ```


## **1. Install CruiseKube using helm**

Install CruiseKube from the OCI registry:

```bash
helm install ck-demo oci://tfy.jfrog.io/tfy-helm/cruisekube --namespace cruisekube-system --create-namespace
```

> **Note:** You can customize the installation by providing your own `values.yaml` file with specific configurations. See the [configuration documentation](config.md) for available options.

## **2. Verify Installation**

Check that the CruiseKube components are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cruisekube-system
```

You should see pods like `cruisekube-controller-manager-xxx` and `cruisekube-webhook-server-xxx` in the `Running` state.

## **3. Enable Tasks**

By default, all tasks are disabled. This is to prevent any unintended optimizations. 
You will need to manually enable each task based on your requirements. To do this, you will need to pass the values to the Helm chart.
In values, set the environment variables for each task you want to enable. Some critical tasks are mentioned below. 


### **a. Enable Create Stats Task**

The `CreateStats` task builds per-workload time-series and statistical summaries (CPU, memory usage, OOM counts, pod counts, etc.). These are the basis for recommendations and historical analysis.

### **b. Enable Recommendation Task**

The `Recommendation` task analyzes the statistical summaries generated by the `CreateStats` task to derive resource recommendations for workloads.

### **c. Enable Auto-apply Recommendations Task**

By default Recommendation tasks
