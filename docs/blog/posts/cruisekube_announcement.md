# Introducing CruiseKube - Runtime Resource Optimization for Kubernetes

<img src="../../../../../images/logo/cruiseKube_Colour.png" alt="CruiseKube Logo" width="200">

Today, we’re excited to announce the release of **CruiseKube** - a runtime resource optimization engine for Kubernetes that continuously right-sizes pods *without restarts*, unlocking significant cost efficiency gains while preserving reliability.

# What is CruiseKube?

CruiseKube is a Kubernetes-native, continuous resource optimization system that autonomously right-sizes CPU and memory for workloads at runtime and admission time. It focuses on eliminating persistent over-provisioning while preserving workload reliability and scheduling constraints.

Unlike static requests, manual tuning, or reactive autoscaling, CruiseKube operates as a closed-loop control system that observes real workload behavior and incrementally converges resource requests toward optimal values.

## When do you need CruiseKube?

You would need CruiseKube if you are facing any of these issues -

- Chronic over-provisioning driven by guesswork, peak-based sizing, and fear of CPU throttling or OOM crashes
- Cost inefficiency that node-level bin packing as provided by autoscalers (Cluster Autoscaler/Karpenter) alone cannot fix
- Operational Load arising from manual tuning of workloads on Kubernetes by developers or DevOps teams

CruiseKube explicitly addresses the pod-level right-sizing problem, in a fully hands-off manner.

## How does it work?

At a high level, CruiseKube has the following components -

- **Statistics Engine**: Fetches real-time CPU and memory usage at pod and node level from Prometheus and stores them in a database
- **Runtime Optimizer**: Continuously optimizes pod-level resources for running pods across the cluster. It leverages the statistics generated by the statistics engine to generate recommendations per pod
- **Admission Optimizer**: Intercepts new pod creations and optimizes the resources of the pod before it is scheduled. This provides a safety net to ensure that the pod is scheduled on a node with sufficient capacity.

Together, these components allow CruiseKube to take ownership of the resource assignment process for pods, ensuring that the pods are always running with the optimal resources.

## Why is it different?

CruiseKube is different from other resource optimization tools in the following ways -

- Changes are done at pod-level, rather than workload level, thus avoiding the need to restart pods
- Utilizes PSI adjusted usage to take CPU contention into account for CPU optimization
- Takes OOM into account for memory optimization and reacts to OOM kills in real-time to improve reliability
- Optimizes across pods on the same node by sharing resources between all pods, thus improving the node level resource utilization
- Provides an interface to the user to configure priorities and other controls for the optimization process

## Getting Started

Getting started with CruiseKube is as simple as installing the `cruisekube` helm chart with appropriate values. Please follow the [installation guide](../../src/gs-installation.md) to get started.

## What's next?

By open-sourcing CruiseKube, we are pushing the boundaries of what is possible with Kubernetes resource optimization. Do get involved in the community by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dqek4xJa3N) server and sharing your feedback and ideas.
